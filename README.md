# Microbiome Analysis for Peri-Implant Inflammation
## Introduction
This project aims to explore the relationship between microbial composition and peri-implant inflammation in patients. By analyzing microbial abundance data obtained from patients, we aim to uncover potential patterns and insights that may be associated with inflammation. The project involves both unsupervised clustering techniques and the potential for future supervised machine learning approaches.

## Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:

* Data Collection: Microbial abundance data from patients with peri-implant inflammation is collected and preprocessed.

* Unsupervised Clustering: Initial exploration involves unsupervised clustering techniques to group samples based on microbiome compositions.

* Feature Engineering: If available, additional patient metadata and inflammation status labels can be integrated into the dataset.

* Supervised Learning (Future Step): Once labeled data is available, supervised machine learning algorithms will be employed to predict inflammation status based on microbial data.

* Analysis and Insights: The results will be analyzed to identify potential microbial compositions associated with peri-implant inflammation.

## Data
The dataset used in this project includes microbial abundance data at various taxonomic levels. Each row represents a patient sample, and the columns represent microbial abundance counts. Unfortunately, inflammation status labels are not included in the current dataset.

* Microbial Abundance Data: ASV to pm9 columns represent the abundance of various microbial taxa.
